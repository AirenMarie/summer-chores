This is a Code:You exercise for practicing the use of asynchronous code in JavaScript.

First, a person will carry out a list of chores using callback functions and setTimeOut.

Next, that same person will complete their chores using promises chained in a function by .then() .catch() methods.

Finally, they will do these chores one last time using async/await.
